# Hello GenAI Lab Assignment

This is a super simple lab to test that you have your Amazon EC2 and VSCode setup done correctly. Once you connect to your Amazon EC2 from VSCode, clone this repo, run the code, and submit the output.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- A Groq API key (sign up [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com))

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install uv

uv is a modern Python package manager that makes dependency management fast and reliable.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

After installation, restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

Verify installation:
```bash
uv --version
```

### Step 2: Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using uv:

```bash
cd hello-genai
uv sync
```

This will read the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file and install all required packages:
- `groq` - Python client for the Groq API to interact with fast language models
- `requests` - HTTP library for fetching EC2 instance metadata

### Step 3: Configure API Key

Place your Groq API key in a file named `.apikey` in the project directory:

```bash
echo "your_api_key_here" > .apikey
```

Note: The `.apikey` file is already included in [.gitignore](.gitignore) to prevent accidentally committing your API key to version control.

## Task 1: Run Hello GenAI (100 Points)

### Objective
Successfully run the [hello.py](hello.py) script that demonstrates interaction with Groq's fast language models.

### What the Script Does
The script:
1. Fetches EC2 instance metadata using IMDSv2 to confirm the code is running on Amazon EC2
2. Connects to the Groq API using your API key
3. Sends a chat completion request asking about the importance of fast language models
4. Uses the `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model
5. Prints the AI-generated response along with EC2 instance details (instance ID, type, region, etc.)

### Running the Script

Execute the following commands (this sets the API key from the `.apikey` file and runs the script):

```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=$(cat .apikey)
uv run python hello.py 2>&1 | tee output.txt
```

This will display the output on screen and also save it to `output.txt` for submission.

### Expected Output

You should see a detailed response explaining the importance of fast language models. The output will be several paragraphs discussing topics such as:
- Real-time applications
- User experience improvements
- Cost efficiency
- Scalability benefits
- And more

### Troubleshooting

**Error: "GROQ_API_KEY not found"**
- Make sure you've set the environment variable correctly
- Verify it's set by running: `echo $GROQ_API_KEY`

**Error: "Module not found: groq"**
- Run `uv sync` to install dependencies
- Verify installation: `uv pip list | grep groq`

**Error: "Invalid API key"**
- Check that your API key is correct
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or quotes in the environment variable

## Submission Requirements

To receive full credit (10 points), submit the `output.txt` file that was generated when you ran the script.
